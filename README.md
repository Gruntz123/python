# Welcome! Bem vindos! Bienvenidos! Benvenuti!
I am very happy to present my first, end-to-end python project.

# Goals
The main goal of this project is to showcase my data analysis skills, applied to finance.

The following technical and non-technical skills will be addressed:

1. Documentation
2. Finance
3. Statistics
4. Visualization
5. Soft Skills
6. Python (hehe)
7. Simplifying capabilities

# Summary
This project aims to create a Multiple Linear Regression Model, focusing on indexes influences on the index fund 'SPY'.

We are going to create a trading strategy based on:

"Predicting the open price price for SPY, applying a signal trading strategy, having in mind global indexes from the U.S, Europe and Asia. If the signal is positive, we stay long. If the signal is negative, we stay short."

If you don't know what this means, do not worry. I will explain all concepts in this project.

We are going above and beyond, as I will try to explain this project for a real beginner (make the complex simple). Also, we will hypothetically present the project to stakeholders, filtering the most relevant data and choosing the best visualization tool.

THIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION.

# Dataset
We are going to import and analyze data from Yahoo Finance, using the 'yfinance' package.

The 8 indices we will use to train and test our hypothesis to predict 'SPY' are listed below.

**Asia**
1. AORD: the All Ordinaries is designed to measure the 500 largest companies in the Australian equities market, drawn from eligible companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

2. Nikkei 225: widely used globally as representative indicators of the Japanese equity market.

3. HSI: freefloat-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted stock-market index in Hong Kong.

**U.S**
4. SP500: stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

5. NASDAQ: The Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

6. Dow Jones: stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

**Europe**
7. CAC 40: The index represents a capitalization-weighted measure of the 40 most significant stocks among the 100 largest market caps on the Euronext Paris.

8. DAX: The DAX is a stock market index consisting of the 40 major German blue chip companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

The information about each index were taken mostly from Wikipedia.
